Rib Pillar Stability Assessment in Underground Mines Using Strand7



I developed a comprehensive project in Strand7, focusing on the stability and optimization of rib pillars in underground mining operations. The project aimed to analyze the influence of varying rib pillar widths on their factor of safety, employing geotechnical parameters such as Young's Modulus, Poisson's Ratio, and Compressive Strength to model and assess stability. Through rigorous numerical modeling and simulations, I explored the implications of different rib pillar widths on the factor of safety, essential for ensuring safety and stability in underground mining. By leveraging Strand7's powerful numerical modeling capabilities, the study provided valuable insights into the behavior of rib pillars under changing conditions. The project ultimately offered recommendations for optimizing rib pillar width and implementing support measures to enhance underground mining safety and efficiency.
